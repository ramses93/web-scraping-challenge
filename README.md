# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

## Overview

I performed nitial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter. I scraped the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) to collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. I visited the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://space-facts.com/mars/) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc. I used MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped.
